Tracks orbits of particles in cosmological N-body simulations by identifying pericentric passages about the centers of 
bound structures.

The code is designed to be agnostic to the simulation format by allowing the user to specify their own equivalents to 
the functions given in `orbitanalysis/funcs.py`. To use the available functions and/or to run the example script as is, 
you must install [simtools](https://github.com/kriswalker/simtools).
